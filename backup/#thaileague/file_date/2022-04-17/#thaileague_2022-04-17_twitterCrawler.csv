Josh is having a brilliant season in the Khon Kaen United defence and is definitely one of the reasons they are staying up.

A fiery first half with a red card followed by a battle as Khon Kaen held on for a 2-2 draw. Enjoyed alongside families of Khon Kaen players. Good #ThaiLeague fare and my first time out to Thammasat University's Rangsit Campus. https://t.co/ImQ5SS1pC0,/ThaiLeague,1,0,2,17/04/2022,21:59,positive

Khon Kaen opened amazingly well but the red card and first half events were crazy. I was sitting right near it. I think Khon Kaen would be happy to hold on for a point in the end. #ThaiLeague https://t.co/jDxDsPOpoU,/ThaiLeague,1,0,0,17/04/2022,17:14,positive
