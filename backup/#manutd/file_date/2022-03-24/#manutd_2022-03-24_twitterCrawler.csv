#manutd,en,Man Utd Latest,@ManUtdLatestCom,2022-03-24 08:00:07+00:00,,Why Manchester United candidate Erik ten Hag failed his Tottenham interview last summer #mufc #ManUtd https://t.co/8Yd2udTkCn,/mufc/ManUtd,2,1,1,24/03/2022,08:00,negative
#manutd,en,United Paper 🇩🇪,@PaperUtd,2022-03-24 07:52:50+00:00,Manchester,"Erik ten Hag is said to have spoken well during his interview, and Utd think that the fact that Ajax's system, which leaves the manager to coach the team rather than be responsible for recruitment and other matters, would suit Ten Hag if appointed.
